# Contributing guidelines

## Filing issues

If you have a bug to report or feature request that hasn't been filed yet, please open an issue.

Also feel free to open an issue if you have questions, because that may benefit others in the future.

## Pull requests

When you open a pull request, please write a short description of what your change is, and why you think the change is necessary (unless it's already obvious why).

If you intend on making a large change, please open an issue first to discuss the change beforehand so no effort is wasted.
